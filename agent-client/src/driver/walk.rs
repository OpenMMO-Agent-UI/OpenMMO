//! One walker, for every walk the agent takes.
//!
//! There used to be two — one for a fixed place, one for a moving target —
//! and each had grown its own answer to the same questions: what to do when
//! A* finds no route, when the server snaps us back, when a shut door stands
//! in the way. Every disagreement was a bug. The chase ignored position
//! corrections outright; the commute, given no route, sent nothing at all and
//! froze the body, since the server only reconciles the two sims off a step
//! it can refuse.
//!
//! What a walk is for now lives entirely in [`WalkTo`] and its [`Tuning`]
//! row; the loop is the same one either way.
