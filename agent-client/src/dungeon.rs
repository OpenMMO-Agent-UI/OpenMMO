//! Dungeon navigation for the agent: the generated layouts plus the geometry

//! model and the passability rebuild all live in the shared crate — the same
//! code the server runs and the browser calls through wasm — so nothing here
//! can drift from them.
//!
//! The agent sends its own Y, and the server derives the floor it collides
//! against from that Y (`get_floor_at_position`), so every step inside a
//! dungeon must carry the height the shared model computes. A move that keeps
//! the surface Y is refused the moment it reaches a wall that only exists
